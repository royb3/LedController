LedController
=============

A led controller library written in C#, and a modified arduino program wich was origanaly written by (i think) adafruit for adalight.
The arduino program uses FastSPI, wich you can download here: https://code.google.com/p/fastspi/downloads/list
For me FastSPI_20121014.zip works great.

The arduino program works with my led strand wich uses the lpd6803 ic.
If you're using any other controller, use the original led stream programs for your arduino. Or find another replacement.
you can find the original ones here: https://github.com/adafruit/Adalight/tree/master/Arduino
